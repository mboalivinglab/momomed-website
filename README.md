# momoMED - Mobile money for healthcare

momoMED expands the healthcare safety net to African families by automatically saving a small percentage of momo transfers in a healthcare wallet. The money available in the wallet can then be used to pay for discounted healthcare products and services at registered healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.

momoMED seeks to increase access to emergency healthcare financing in countries like Cameroon where only 6% of the population pays for insurance. This innovative solution contributes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal #3 Good Health and Well-Being and #10 Reduced Inequalities.
